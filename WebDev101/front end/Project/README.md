This is the first project for The Odin Project. The goal was to build a web page that was a similar match to the Google homepage, of course, without all the extras like the dropdown menus, search histories, or functioning search engine attached. As this was a beginner project, and we didn't have access to all the assets like icons, it would be pointless to recreate the whole thing for what we're trying to accomplish before moving on. I had a lot of issues with positioning at first but found working methods to get it to be viewed equally across web pages of all sizes, whether the browser was cut in half or not. It was a good learning experience.
