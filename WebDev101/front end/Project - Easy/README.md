This is the first project for The Odin Project. The goal was to build a web page that was a similar match to the Google homepage, of course, without all the extras like the dropdown menus, search histories, or functioning search engine attached.
I had a lot of issues with positioning at first but found the best method to get it to be viewed equally across web pages
of all sizes, whether the browser was cut in half or not. It was a good learning experience.
